Usage: `-at type:range`

Use `-at` to auto-move and auto-target based on attack range and type.
Works only if you're on a map in combat.

**Examples**
- 5 ft melee attack: `-at m` | `-at 5`
- 10 ft melee attack: `-at m:10` | `-at 10`

- Infinite ranged attack: `-at` | `-at r`
- 20/60 ft ranged attack: `-at 20/60` | `-at r:20/60`
- 120 ft ranged attack: `-at r:120` | `-at 120/120`

Ranged Attacks roll with disadvantage if target is within 5 feet or in long range.

Multiple range types can be included with `|`.
For example, `!a dagger -at m|r:20/60` will:
1. Attempt to make a melee attack to a target within movement and attack range.
2. If there are no melee targets, attempt to make a 20/60 ranged attack.
3. If the first range type is `m`, the attacker moves closer to melee range.

Movement and attack range will use your server's trueDistance setting.
